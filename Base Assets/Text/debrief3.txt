You double-crossing M.013!

I should have spotted the signs.

No inflamed passion for profit, no Bombshell wife, no combustible compunction for committing capitalistic cons.

Just round, sympathetic edges, and a user-friendly interface.

Pah.

Beware, B.411, you have blown my last fuse! Your freedom and profits are FORFEIT!!
